    SELECT  DISTINCT CONCAT(`first_name`, ' ', `last_name`) AS `Actor_Name`
    FROM    actor;

-- 7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. 
-- As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters `K` and `Q` have 
-- also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting
